Ideologies shape the world—for better or worse. They seep into our politics, economies, cultures, and personal lives, influencing how we see ourselves and others. But in a world saturated with competing narratives, many dripping with vindictiveness, how do you separate the meaningful from the misguided? How do you judge an ideology for what it truly *is*, rather than what it *pretends* to be?

The answer is simpler than you'd think. Stop listening to what ideologies *claim* about themselves. Start paying attention to what they *produce*.

## 1. **Judge by the Fruits**

You don't need a PhD in philosophy to evaluate an ideology. You just need the wisdom to look at its outcomes. The Bible lays this out with brutal clarity: *"By their fruits you will recognize them"* (Matthew 7:16). It's not about lofty mission statements or theoretical purity—it's about real-world consequences.

But before you can judge an ideology by its fruits, you need to know what *good* fruit looks like. The Bible sets the standard in Galatians 5:22-23: *"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control."* These are the hallmarks of a healthy spirit—and by extension, a healthy ideology.

Just as important, though, is knowing what a healthy ideology is *not*. A healthy ideology does not pit people against each other, turning communities into battlegrounds. It does not seek to punish people for perceived historical injustices, perpetuating cycles of blame and resentment. And it certainly does not judge people based on physical characteristics, but rather on the fruits of their spirit—their character, actions, and integrity.

So ask yourself: Does the ideology foster gratitude, resilience, harmony, and stability? Or does it breed entitlement, bitterness, division, and chaos? The fruits never lie. If an ideology consistently produces fractured relationships, societal discord, or personal misery, then it doesn't matter how noble or insightful its core principles might sound—the well is poisoned.

Take feminism. In its foundational manifestations, it fought for women's rights—the ability to vote, own property, have equal access to opportunity and participate fully in public life. These were just and noble causes, rooted in deeply biblical principles that emphasized dignity and equality. But fast forward to today, and the fruits of modern feminism tell a different story. Is it fostering strong, cooperative relationships between people? Is it promoting gratitude for the universal freedoms  secured? Or has it devolved into a culture of perpetual grievance, where victimhood is a badge of honour and hostility towards each other is the default stance?

If you're judging by the fruits, the answer is obvious.

But let's be clear—feminism isn't the only ideology bearing poisoned fruit.

## 2. **The Poisoned Well of the Manosphere**

If feminism represents one side of this corrupted ideological spectrum, the manosphere is its warped reflection. This cluster of androcentric ideologies claims to counterbalance feminism's gynocentrism, but in reality, it's the same poison served to a different audience.

The Hermetic principle of polarity teaches us that opposites are identical in nature but different in degree. Feminism and the manosphere might seem like ideological enemies at first glance, but scratch the surface and you'll find they share the same rotten core: grievance, factionalism, entitlement, and a refusal to take personal responsibility.

Where modern feminism casts men as oppressors and glorifies victimhood, the manosphere demonizes women as manipulative and festers in resentment. Both movements are obsessed with blame, both thrive on division, and both cultivate followers who are perpetually angry, spiritually sick, and incapable of producing any fruits of real value.

So no, this isn’t about singling out feminism. The truth cuts deeper: *most* ideologies are poisoned. And if one ideology is tainted, you can be certain its counterpart is too. When the entire spectrum is corrupted, choosing sides is pointless—you're still drinking from the same poisoned well.

## 3. **Is It Connected to Its Source?**

Every movement starts somewhere. It draws from a source—a foundational set of values or beliefs that give it meaning and direction. But what happens when an ideology disconnects from that source?

It festers. It decays.

Feminism is a perfect example. This movement owes its very existence to Christianity. Yes, *Christianity*. The radical idea that all humans are made in the image of God (*imago Dei*) laid the groundwork for moral equality. Jesus’ treatment of women—engaging them as equals, valuing their testimony, and elevating their dignity—was revolutionary for its time. Paul reinforced this in Galatians 3:28: *"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."* This foundational belief in the inherent equality of all people is what made movements like feminism and the cultures that elevated them possible. But when ideologies like feminism sever themselves from these roots, they lose their grounding and begin to decay.

Modern feminism has severed that connection. Instead of acknowledging the Christian roots that nurtured its growth, it actively distances itself from them. The result? A movement separated from any objective moral framework, drifting into relativism, factionalism, entitlement and resentment.

The manosphere isn't exempt from this rejection of roots either. Many of its proponents claim to stand for traditional values, but those values are hollow and corrupting when divorced from the spiritual and moral framework that originally gave them meaning. Without the grounding of grace, responsibility, humility, and temperance, traditionalism becomes just another excuse for bitterness and blame.

Any ideology that cuts itself off from its source doesn’t evolve—it rots. Without the grounding of grace, responsibility, and gratitude, what remains is hollow activism fueled by bitterness.

## 4. **Gratitude as a Litmus Test**

You want a quick way to judge an ideology? Check for gratitude. It’s that simple.

Gratitude is the compass of a healthy spirit. It signals an awareness of the blessings afforded and progress made, even in the face of ongoing challenges. Movements grounded in gratitude build on their successes with humility and a sense of stewardship.

But ideologies that lack gratitude are unstable. They feed on perpetual dissatisfaction, constantly shifting the goalposts to maintain a narrative of grievance. This isn’t about ignoring real struggles—it’s about recognizing when the struggle has become a crutch and when proponents have transformed themselves into unhinged crusaders.

When a movement refuses to practice gratitude, it reveals its true motives: wrath, retribution and power, not justice and equality. Feminism today, in many corners, isn’t about equality—it’s about control, hierarchy and penalty. The manosphere isn’t any better—it rejects almost all forms of accountability, drowning in self-pity while blaming women for every frustration. Both are steeped in grievance, both feed off division, and both poison the hearts and minds of anyone who clings to them.

The absence of gratitude isn't just a red flag—it's a blaring siren. Frankly, if a person can't express gratitude, you don't even want to be in the same room as them. They don't just carry negativity—they *leech* toxicity. They're not just ungrateful; they're twisted and corrosive to everyone around them.

## 5. **Beware the Perpetual Victim**

Victimhood is seductive. It absolves responsibility, justifies entitlement, and demands sympathy. But when victimhood becomes a permanent identity, it’s a sign of spiritual sickness.

People who cling to grievance as a core part of who they are—whether individually or collectively—aren’t just  struggling. They’re *committed* to their suffering in such a way that it is multiplied. They’ve built their worldview around the belief that they are persecuted, no matter how much evidence suggests otherwise.

This isn’t just a psychological issue—it’s a moral one. Perpetual victims become corrosive to those around them. Their bitterness seeps into relationships, communities, and even entire cultures. They’re not interested in solutions, integration or alignment because these concepts threaten the identity they’ve cultivated.

And here’s the hard truth: if you surround yourself with people who refuse to heal, they will drag you down with them. Misery loves company, but you don’t have to subscribe to that. You can always disconnect.

## 6. **Compassion Without Compromise**

Now, let’s be clear. Recognizing the poisoned fruits of an ideology doesn’t mean turning your back on the people caught in its grip. Compassion isn’t about softening your stance—it’s about standing firm. True compassion refuses to compromise because enabling someone’s delusions or bitterness isn’t love—it’s surrender. Remember, we are called to reject the sin, not the sinner. This is the balance—offering mercy without condoning the poison.

Christ didn’t turn His back on the broken, but He also didn’t coddle them in their misery. He called them to *repent*, to *rise*, to *change*. Love is not about enabling people—it’s about holding up a mirror and setting boundaries.

When dealing with people trapped in toxic ideologies, the challenge is to offer a path forward without getting pulled into toxicity. You can be a witness to their struggles without becoming entangled in their patterns. But that requires clarity and strength—the ability to stand firm in your values while expecting others to rise to the occasion. A complicit person cannot be a righteous person. Standing idly by or enabling destructive behaviours and ideologies makes you part of the problem. True righteousness means rejecting the poison, even if it means standing alone.

And if they refuse? That’s on them. You are not obligated to carry the burden of someone else’s spiritual sickness. Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do for a person is step back and let them face the consequences of their choices.

## 7. **Live as the Counterexample**

Here’s the ultimate power move when all else fails: don’t argue. Don’t engage in endless debates with ideologues who are committed to misunderstanding you. Live your life in a way that *contradicts* everything they claim.

Do you value stability, gratitude, and accountability? Show it. Build a life of quiet strength, grounded in principles that stand the test of time. Let your relationships, your peace, and your resilience be the proof.

There’s a verse in 1 Peter 3:16 that says it best: *"Keep a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander."* Your life’s fruits will outshine any ideology’s empty promises or warped worldviews.

## Final Thought: The Fruits Don’t Lie

In the end, judging an ideology isn’t about dissecting its mission statements, engaging with mountains of literature or debating its theoretical merits. It’s about looking at the tangible results—the *fruits* it bears in the lives of its followers and the culture it shapes.

When the fruits are bitterness, division,  entitlement and resentment the ideology is rotten at its core. When it disconnects from the roots that gave it life, it’s destined to decay. And when its adherents are trapped in perpetual victimhood, you can be sure their spirits are poisoned and that they will try to poison your spirit too.

But you don’t have to be part of that sickness. You don’t have to fix it, debate it, or even engage with it. Live in a way that bears good fruit—the kind that speaks louder than any ideology ever could.

Let the fruits do the talking. The rest will take care of itself.

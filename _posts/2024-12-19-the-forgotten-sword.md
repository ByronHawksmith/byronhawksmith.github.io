title: "The Forgotten Sword"
---

There is a weapon each of us carries, though many have forgotten it exists. It’s sharper than steel, more enduring than stone. It is the sword of intellect, of critical thought, of self-awareness—and for too long, society has dulled its edge. Worse still, it has convinced us to lay it down entirely, leaving us defenseless in a world that thrives on manipulation, distraction, and control.

Look around. What do you see? A society bloated with consumption yet starving for meaning. People who trade their autonomy for convenience, their awareness for entertainment, and their potential for fleeting comfort. This is no accident. This decay is not the natural order; it is the result of deliberate disempowerment. A society that strips its people of their ability to think critically or act courageously does so not out of ignorance but intent. Why? Because dull, disengaged minds are easier to control. A person that does not know they have a sword within their grasp will never think to wield it.

## The System of Decay

We’ve built a world that thrives on cognitive and spiritual decline. The messages we consume, the systems we navigate, the very structure of our daily lives—all of it conspires to keep us distracted, passive, and pliable. The algorithms spoon-feed us endless streams of content, not to enlighten but to pacify. The institutions churn out uniformity, not to educate but to ensure obedience. The culture whispers that we are not enough, that we must buy, achieve, and conform to fill the void.

This is more than disrespect. It’s an act of war against the human spirit. It’s a denial of the divine potential that resides within each of us. To strip someone of their sword—to convince them they are unarmed and powerless—is to rob them of their agency, their dignity, and their future.

And the tragedy is, most people believe it. They walk through life unaware of their own radiance, blind to the power they possess, convinced by a thousand tiny lies that they are unworthy of love, unworthy of respect, unworthy of greatness. These lies disgust me—not just because of their cruelty but because of the profound waste they represent. Humanity is capable of so much more.

## The Call to Arms

But here’s the truth: the sword is still there. It has always been there, waiting for its wielder to remember. The power to think critically, to question boldly, to create fearlessly, is not gone—it is simply forgotten. And it can be remembered.

This is why I write. Every word, every idea, every challenge is a slash of the sword—not to wound but to wake. I strike because I want you to parry. I don’t care if you agree with me; in fact, I hope you don’t. I hope you pick up your blade, sharpen it, and engage. My goal is not to be right; my goal is to remind you of your power.

Many will resist this call. They will say they have no time, no energy, no interest in such things. They will cling to their comforts and distractions, preferring the soft blur of ignorance to the sharp clarity of awareness. But some—perhaps you—will feel the stir of something deeper. A memory of the sword, a recognition of the truth, a desire to awaken.

## Iron Sharpens Iron

Engagement is not always easy. To wield a sword, you must practice. To sharpen it, you must embrace friction. This is why honest debate, critical thought, and intellectual challenge are so vital—they are the forge in which we are refined. Without them, our minds grow dull, our spirits complacent, our potential unfulfilled.

The society we need, the society we could become, is one where _iron sharpens iron_. A society of thinkers and creators, not consumers. A society where every individual stands tall, wielding their sword with confidence, contributing their unique perspective to the grand conversation of life. This is not a utopia; it is a possibility. But it requires effort. It requires courage. It requires you.

## The Radiance Within

At its core, this vision is about love. Love for humanity’s potential. Love for the divine spark within each person. Love for the truth that we are not passive vessels but radiant beings, capable of greatness, worthy of dignity, and bound together by our shared pursuit of meaning.

To awaken to this truth is to reject the lies of unworthiness and scarcity. It is to see yourself as you truly are: radiant, powerful, and deeply loved. And once you see this in yourself, you cannot help but see it in others. This is how we build a society of strength and prosperity—not through domination or division but through the shared recognition of our divine worth.

## A Vision Worth Fighting For

Imagine it: a society where every person is awake, aware, and engaged. A society where debate is not divisive but enriching, where every challenge sharpens rather than wounds, where strength flows from unity and truth. Its prosperity would be unparalleled, its strength unshakable, its beauty beyond measure.

This is the society we could build. But it starts with individuals who are willing to remember their swords, to pick them up, and to wield them with purpose. It starts with you.

So I leave you with a choice: Will you remain as you are, unarmed and unaware? Or will you take up your sword, sharpen it, and step into the arena? The world needs you—radiant, self-aware, empowered. Will you answer the call?

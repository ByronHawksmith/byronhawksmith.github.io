Romantic love is the most extraordinary gift that two people can share. It is a bridge that connects souls, a spark that ignites meaning in the mundane, and a force that transforms individuals into something greater than themselves. But romantic love, unchecked and unguarded, can also become a tool for exploitation, a weapon that erodes dignity, and a tether that binds us to pain. To love well, we must understand its boundaries, and to protect those boundaries, we must love ourselves enough to walk away when love becomes a shadow of its true self.

## Romantic Love as a Gift, Not a Transaction

When you love someone fully, you give them parts of yourself—your time, your attention, your body and even the depths of your soul. There is no room for half-measures or token gestures. Love is an unyielding force, but it is not blind. It does not bow to manipulation, tolerate betrayal, or excuse disrespect. To love unconditionally does not mean to endure unconditionally. The two are not the same.

Romantic love becomes dangerous when we lose sight of its sanctity. It can twist into a desperate plea for validation or a bargain to keep someone who does not honor us. This is not love; it is self-betrayal. And the cost of such compromise is not just heartbreak but the erosion of our spirit.

We must remember that love, in its purest form, is a reflection of divine grace—a gift meant to be shared, not squandered.

## The Pain of Leaving: A Necessary Sacrifice

To love deeply is to expose yourself to profound vulnerability. When that love is unreciprocated or disrespected, the act of taking it back can feel like tearing away a part of your own soul. It is an excruciating process, not just for the one who loses your love, but for you, the one who chooses to walk away.

But this sacrifice is essential. To remain in a relationship where you are exploited, disrespected, or diminished is to betray yourself. It is to declare, through your inaction, that your love is cheap, that your dignity is negotiable, and that your connection to something greater—God, self-respect, purpose—can be set aside for the sake of companionship.

This is a lie. Love that costs you your worth is no love at all. It is a mirage, a counterfeit of the real thing. And you are worth infinitely more than that.

## The Divine Image: A Call to Dignity

People treat you the way you allow them to treat you. Every person, every Christian, has a duty to carry themselves with the dignity and respect befitting someone created in the image of God. To tolerate disrespect, to excuse betrayal, or to accept less than we deserve is to dishonor not only ourselves but the Creator who made us.

Love demands reverence—not only for the other person but for yourself. If you would not dishonor God, you must not allow dishonor in your relationships. If you would not betray God, you must not betray your own sacred boundaries. The way we love our partners should mirror the way we revere the divine—with honor, respect, and an unwavering commitment to truth. There is undoubtedly a place of forgiveness and reconciliation, but always be objective in your assessment of the true nature of your bond to another person.

This standard is not for the faint of heart. It requires vigilance, wisdom, and the courage to say, *“This isn't healthy for me.”* It requires walking away from those who would misuse your love, no matter how much it hurts, and trusting that the love you deserve will come to you in time.

## Love as a Partnership of Growth, Not Decay

Attraction is not arbitrary; it is built on the foundation of the qualities we see and admire in one another. When two people are drawn together, it is because of the specific characteristics they recognize and value in each other in that moment. These are not static; they are not relics of a single instance in time. They are living, breathing aspects of who we are, and they demand cultivation.

Love is not a destination; it is the beginning of a journey. To believe that love allows us to backslide into complacency is to misunderstand its essence entirely. Love is a commitment to remain as vibrant, as passionate, and as grounded as we were when it began—and to grow even stronger in those qualities over time. To stop embodying the traits that first sparked connection is to betray not only your partner but also yourself.

This is the duty of love: *I will be as much as I was, and I will become more.* Love is a partnership of growth, a mutual commitment to evolution. It is not a space where decay and dysfunction are permitted to take root. To truly honor love is to reject the notion that it is something to be passively possessed. Instead, it must be actively cultivated, nurtured, and expanded.

Anything less is not love; it is stagnation. Love calls us to become the best versions of ourselves—not only for our partners but for the sacred bond we share. This is the standard, and it is one that cannot be compromised.

## The Violence of Trying to Change or Degrade a Partner

To love someone is to accept them as you found them, while encouraging them to grow into the best version of themselves. But to attempt to "change" your partner—to mold them into an image of your own making or to debase and degrade them to satisfy your own insecurities—is not love. It is a form of violence.

This violence is not physical, but its impact is no less destructive. It corrodes trust, diminishes self-worth, and turns what should be a sacred bond into a battlefield of control and manipulation. To love someone is to see them clearly, to honor their essence, and to support their growth—not to tear them down or force them to fit into a box of your design.

Love that seeks to control is not love; it is fear. Love that degrades is not love; it is cruelty. If we claim to love someone, our actions must reflect that claim. We must lift them up, never drag them down. We must inspire them to grow, not force them to change. Anything less is an act of betrayal—not only to them but to the very essence of love itself.

## A Love Worth Keeping

In a world that commodifies love, that reduces it to swipes and likes and transactional exchanges, your understanding of love must stand as a beacon of truth. It must be bold, unapologetic, and sacred. It must be a love that refuses to be diluted by convenience or fear. A love that chooses itself when others fail to choose it.

This kind of love is not easy. It requires strength, resilience, and an unshakeable faith in your own worth. But it is the only love worth keeping. To love fully, to give generously, and to set boundaries fiercely is to protect the sanctity of love itself.

In the end, love is not about how much you give or how much you endure. It is about how much you honor the divine spark within yourself and within your partner and how much they honor the divine spark within themselves and within you. It is about creating a relationship that reflects the beauty and dignity of God and indeed of our relationship with *Him*, rooted in the timeless principles found in scripture. Anything less is not love; it is a poor immitation, and it is destined to fail.

*The ultimate question is this: Are you brave enough to demand the love you deserve or will you settle for a life of compromise and deviation?*

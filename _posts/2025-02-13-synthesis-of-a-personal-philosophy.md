There is a thread that runs through all of us—a search for meaning, for coherence in the chaos of life. For me, this thread has led to the careful synthesis of a personal philosophy rooted in Christian Theology, Stoicism, Taoism, and Existentialism. These pillars, though distinct, weave together into a worldview that is balanced, empowering, hopeful, and redemptive. Yet, this synthesis has also involved shedding elements that once seemed vital: Absurdism, Nihilism, Hedonism, Objectivism, Paganism, Cynicism, and Skepticism. The result is not just a worldview but a compass, a structure to keep me grounded, to direct my drive for success and domination in a way that builds rather than destroys. 

This synthesis isn’t arbitrary. It’s the culmination of years of thought, introspection, and experience—a response to the realization that I needed something powerful at my core to keep me from becoming what I despise. Without an anchor, the unchecked pursuit of success and control could lead to monstrous outcomes. Instead, I’ve chosen a path that elevates rather than corrupts, and it is this path I will explore in this post.

## The Four Pillars: Christian Theology, Stoicism, Taoism, and Existentialism

### **Christian Theology: The Spine of Redemption**

Christian Theology is the central pillar of my philosophy—the spine that supports and integrates the others. At its heart is the belief in universal redemption and restoration. I cannot envision a person so lost, so mired in sin or despair, that they cannot choose to climb out of the hole they are in. God doesn’t forsake anyone; His love and grace extend to all, no matter how far they’ve fallen. This belief not only inspires hope but also acts as a moral anchor, a safeguard against the darker aspects of ambition and power.

The teachings of Christ embody the balance I strive for: justice tempered by mercy, truth illuminated by grace, and strength expressed through humility. In moments of anger—especially at those who abuse religion or authority for personal gain—I am reminded of Christ’s righteous indignation at the Pharisees and money changers. Hypocrisy and exploitation disgust me because they represent a betrayal of what is sacred. Yet, even these individuals are not beyond redemption. Their path may lead through metaphysical fire, a grueling process of purification, but it exists because God does not abandon His creations.

Christian Theology provides the structure that ensures my drive for success is oriented toward building something meaningful and aligned with divine purpose. Without it, my ambition could easily spiral into selfishness or destruction.

### **Stoicism: The Discipline of the Inner Fortress**

Where Christian Theology offers a moral framework, Stoicism provides the discipline to live within it. Stoicism teaches resilience, the control of one’s emotions, and the focus on what can be controlled while accepting what cannot. These teachings align seamlessly with Christian virtues such as patience, humility, and perseverance.

Stoicism is particularly valuable in moments of challenge or despair. It reminds me that my response to external events is within my control, even when the events themselves are not. This aligns beautifully with the Christian concept of surrendering to God’s will while maintaining faith and diligence in one’s actions. Together, these philosophies create a dynamic balance: Stoicism strengthens my resolve, while Christian Theology ensures that resolve is directed toward good.

### **Taoism: The Flow of Surrender**

If Stoicism is the discipline of resistance, Taoism is the art of surrender. The Taoist principle of *wu wei* (“effortless action”) teaches me to move with the natural rhythms of life rather than fighting against them. This complements the Christian concept of trusting in God’s providence and the Stoic acceptance of fate.

Taoism brings harmony to my philosophy, reminding me that not every battle needs to be fought and not every situation demands control. It encourages adaptability, humility, and a willingness to let go of what no longer serves. This principle is particularly valuable in a world that often rewards aggression and dominance. Taoism teaches me that true strength lies in fluidity and that by aligning with the natural flow of life, I can achieve more with less effort.

### **Existentialism: The Responsibility of Choice**

Existentialism introduces the profound weight of individual choice and responsibility into my philosophy. At its core, Existentialism emphasizes that life’s meaning is not handed to us but created through our actions and decisions. This resonates deeply with both Stoicism and Christian Theology, reinforcing the idea that we are active participants in shaping our lives.

While Christian Theology provides a divine framework and Stoicism teaches discipline, Existentialism ensures I never shy away from the responsibility of making meaningful choices. It reminds me that even in the face of uncertainty or despair, I have the freedom to choose a higher path. Existentialism rejects passivity, calling instead for engagement, introspection, and the courage to live authentically.

This philosophy also aligns with Taoism’s principle of flowing with life. Rather than imposing meaning from outside, Existentialism challenges me to find meaning within the context of my own existence, guided by faith and wisdom. It keeps me grounded in the understanding that every moment is an opportunity to align with my values and purpose.

## The Cast-Off Elements: What No Longer Serves

Just as important as the pillars that remain are the philosophies I’ve outgrown. These were valuable teachers at one point, but they ultimately proved insufficient.

### **Absurdism and Nihilism**

Absurdism and Nihilism offered an honest confrontation with the void, forcing me to wrestle with the absence of inherent meaning in the universe. However, they failed to provide a constructive way forward. While they taught me resilience in the face of meaninglessness, they also left me hollow and directionless. Christian Theology, with its promise of redemption and divine purpose, filled the void they exposed.

### **Hedonism**

Hedonism, with its focus on pleasure, revealed the fleeting nature of material satisfaction. It taught me that indulgence as an end in itself leads to emptiness rather than fulfillment. This realization pushed me toward philosophies that prioritize lasting peace and spiritual growth over momentary gratification.

### **Objectivism**

Objectivism’s celebration of reason and individualism resonated with my desire for autonomy, but its glorification of self-interest clashed with my belief in humility and service. While it taught me the value of rational thought and personal responsibility, its lack of moral grounding made it incompatible with my deeper values.

### **Paganism**

Paganism fostered an appreciation for nature and ritual but lacked the transcendent, unifying framework I found in Christianity. While I value its reverence for the natural world, it ultimately felt too fragmented and lacked the sense of ultimate accountability that anchors my worldview.

### **Cynicism and Skepticism**

Cynicism and Skepticism encouraged critical thinking and a rejection of falsehoods, but they also fostered isolation and mistrust. While they were useful tools for deconstructing flawed systems, they offered no path for building something better. Christian Theology, Stoicism, and Taoism filled this gap, offering a constructive vision rooted in faith, virtue, and harmony.

## Why Others Choose Differently

As balanced and empowering as my philosophy feels, I often struggle to understand why others choose differently. To me, this synthesis is not only functional but deeply redemptive. Why wouldn’t everyone embrace it? The answer, I’ve come to realize, lies in the diversity of human experience.

### **Different Journeys**

Each person’s worldview is shaped by their unique journey. The philosophies I’ve embraced resonate with my experiences, challenges, and aspirations. Others, having walked different paths, may find meaning in different frameworks. What feels empowering to me might feel restrictive to someone else, and what feels hopeful to me might feel alien to someone shaped by different struggles.

### **Fear of Responsibility**

My philosophy demands immense responsibility: the discipline of Stoicism, the surrender of Taoism, the accountability of Christian Theology, and the courage of Existentialism. Not everyone is ready or willing to bear that weight. Some prefer worldviews that absolve them of responsibility or allow them to project blame outwardly.

### **Fear of Redemption**

Redemption requires confronting one’s brokenness and choosing change. This can feel like death to the ego, and many people are unwilling to face that pain. They may reject redemption not because it’s impossible but because it’s terrifying.

### **Cultural Programming**

Modern culture often glorifies materialism, individualism, and relativism, steering people away from philosophies rooted in transcendence and accountability. Many never question these narratives, adopting them by default.

## Living as an Invitation

Ultimately, my role is not to force my philosophy on others but to live it so authentically and powerfully that it becomes an invitation. When others see the peace, hope, and resilience it brings, they may feel inspired to explore it for themselves. Redemption cannot be imposed; it must be chosen. All I can do is embody the principles I hold dear and extend my hand when others are ready to take it.

## Conclusion

The synthesis of my personal philosophy is a living testament to the interplay of faith, discipline, harmony, and self-determination. It is anchored in Christian Theology, tempered by Stoicism, harmonized by Taoism, and empowered by Existentialism. This balance keeps me grounded, focused, and aligned with a higher purpose. The philosophies I’ve outgrown—Absurdism, Nihilism, Hedonism, Objectivism, Paganism, Cynicism, and Skepticism—were stepping stones that taught me valuable lessons but ultimately fell short of the vision I now embrace.

This philosophy is my compass, my anchor, and my guide. It allows me to strive for success without losing my humanity, to embrace redemption without denying justice, and to live with hope, purpose, and resilience. While others may choose different paths, I remain steadfast in the belief that no one is beyond redemption, that the higher path is always available, and that God never forsakes us.

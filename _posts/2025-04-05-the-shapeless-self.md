For months, I have written with the weight of years pressed against my spine. My work—monuments of pain, scaffolding, frameworks, constraints, suspensions, dissidence, disorientation and disillusion—has been nothing short of war. Not against a nation, not against an institution, but against an idea. A set of people. A system of performance, of identity-worship, of narrative inflation so deeply entrenched in the collective psyche that to question it is to risk exile. So naturally, I questioned it.

I wrote as retaliation. Pure, unflinching, searing retaliation.

Not out of pettiness, not out of cruelty, but because I have spent my entire life being told, in subtle and overt ways, that I am not allowed to retaliate against this system. That some people are beyond question. That some identities are untouchable. That my pain must always be silent, that my critiques must always be polite, that I must wear the muzzle of civility while being dissected by the 'sharp' tongues of others.

So I took the muzzle off.

And I wrote. Pages and pages. Systems of thought so burdened in their construction, that to read them is to suffer along with me. The things I have written about are not wrong, but they are intense and they hold up mirrors—mirrors that reflect the reader back at themselves in ways that feel distorted, cracked, even monstrous.

They are accounts that point to the necessity for a systematic deconstruction of **ALL** identity. But they are not academic or sterile. They are personal. They are bloodied. They are intimate. And they were created for one reason only:

**To bring the gift of questioning to those who think themselves unquestionable.**

Those who believe they’ve already arrived. Who demand reverence for their stories, their categories, their crusades, and their carefully curated suffering. The door-to-door ideologues, cloaked in all the colors of the rainbow, leveraging symbols they didn’t create and barely understand. The self-appointed arbiters of truth, declaring what is and isn't with a hollow certainty and a taste for self-exaltation.

To them, I offered darkness.

Not malice. Not evil. *Darkness.* A substance so dense it absorbs all projections. A force that melts the pinwheel and the stick holding it, too. Not because I wanted to hurt—but because I wanted to **reveal**. To create a *proof by contradiction* so unbearable, so undeniable, that it would force vital questions to emerge:

"What is the purpose of having an identity?" "Who am I when no one is watching?" "What pain have I mistaken for an identity?" "Would I even recognize myself without an audience or a tribe?" "How much of what I think I am is just a story?"

This is not the work of a cynic. This is the work of someone who *believes*. Who believes in the capacity of human beings to change when confronted with themselves. Who believes in the necessity of discomfort for growth. Who believes that maybe—*just maybe*—there is still the capacity for those who have built entire identities around a wounded self image, to get up and walk away from their illusions.

But here is the twist. The contradiction:

In this process, I became the very thing I am warning others about.

Consumed by my own story of suffering. Shaped by how I interpreted my pain. I weaponized that pain with precision—cutting, deliberate, intentional. I built an identity around my wounds, even as I critiqued others for doing the same. I warned against the dangers of a wounded architecture while assembling one of my own brick by brick. That’s the kind of uncomfortable paradox real growth creates.

And then it hit me, as quietly as it could:

**"I haven't lived up to my own standards."**

Not because my rage was unjustified. Not because my critique lacked merit. But because the person I had to become to deliver this message was, in many ways, already dead. A war-self. A weaponized self. A brilliant, burning, necessary self—but not a sustainable one. Not a joyful one. Not a creative one.

And I am tired of dying over and over again.

Tired of constructing identities only to watch them fall under the weight of their own contradictions. Tired of wearing new names only to find them just as suffocating as the old ones. Tired of constantly performing a version of self that only exists in reaction to the endless projections of other people. Tired of watching everyone else do the same thing ad nauseam.

I am a substance that cannot be contained. There is no permanence to me. I am more fluid than fluid. I am shapeless, nameless, unquantifiable.

And when I allow myself to be that formless, I come alive.

I become creative. I experience joy. I return to something that feels sacred: a child like state of mind. A state of pure, sacred engagement and wonder. A force that moves, not for recognition or reward, but simply because *it's called to move*. Have you ever watched a child so lost in play you could not pull them away? That is what it feels like when the performance ends and the *real* begins.

That’s where I’m going now. To draw outside of the lines and up and down the walls.

I am stepping away from the war-self. Not because it wasn’t useful—it was. Not because it wasn’t powerful—it *still is*. But because it is done. The work is complete. The message has been delivered. The contradictions have been documented.

What comes next is not performance. Not narrative. Not identity.

What comes next is **creation.**

Not because I have to create. Not because I am proving something. But because I *want to create*. Because the joy of creating something interesting with my own hands is the only thing that feels *truly* worthwhile.

I've found no joy in the construction of identities or in chasing the illusion of "self-discovery." Every system of thought I've encountered collapses under its own weight. The more credentials and labels a person collects, the more their thinking seems to thin out. Share your worldview with me, and I’ll likely melt it down to its base parts—because that’s where something honest might begin inside you.

So believe me when I say, from the bottom of my heart: I don’t care about your story, or the identity you’ve cloaked yourself in—and I don’t care about mine either. If you get to choose yours, I get to choose mine—and you will not like what I choose. This is the kindest expression I can offer—let me be free of my shadow. Don’t start an arms race of identification with me that you're not willing to see through.

Show me what you can make. Show me the garden you grew, the poem you whispered, the code you architected, the instrument you learned, the song you wrote when no one was watching. I'm deeply interested in your capacity for creativity and in the works you can produce with your hands. Your creativity brings me joy.

I've had enough of performance, of positioning, of posturing and maneuvering. Enough of a sacred victimhood paraded as currency. Enough of an emotional economy so paper thin it can’t carry meaning. I expect more—from you, from myself, from all of us.

Be formless. Be shapeless. Be uncontainable.

Because in these characteristics, in that refusal to endlessly perform for an audience of spectators, there is the most radical joy imaginable.

Let the culture wars end. Let the swords fall. Let the false selves slip away. Remember the parts of you that never needed slogans, or banners, or uniforms. Be formless. Be shapeless. Dissolve into what’s real. 

And when the world asks who you are, don't answer with a label. Don't answer with a grievance. Don't answer with a flag or a hashtag or a wounded narrative.

Just say: **"Watch. I'll show you."**

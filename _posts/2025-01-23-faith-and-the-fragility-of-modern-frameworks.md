Somewhere out there, right now, there’s someone kneeling in prayer, asking God to help them escape their dependency on brain altering medications that are steadily eroding their life. This person isn’t just praying for relief; they’re praying for freedom—freedom from a system that promised healing but instead delivered a cold, clinical half-life with a subscription fee to match. It’s not hard to imagine that this person—had they been introduced to faith, prayer, and the grounding power of loving community earlier in their journey—might never have needed those medications in the first place.

And yet, in our modern world, this perspective is often ridiculed. Faith is dismissed as a placebo, while pharmaceutical solutions are revered as the pinnacle of progress. But the truth is that faith—even if it were "just" a placebo—has delivered transformative results for centuries. If prayer calms the storm of suicidal thoughts, if it replaces despair with hope, who cares whether some call it a placebo? What matters is that it works. Meanwhile, countless people dutifully swallow medications that keep them just barely alive and stumble through therapeutic frameworks—frameworks that often fail to address the spiritual voids and existential wounds at the heart of their suffering.

Now, it would be irresponsible of me not to say this: **Do not stop taking your medication if you are already on it. DO NOT DO THAT.** What I am saying is this: there are alternative frameworks to explore—frameworks that challenge the belief systems keeping you trapped in the same cycle of thought and suffering.

## **Faith as a Framework**

To dismiss faith is to misunderstand it. Faith is not the enemy of reason; it’s a framework for meaning. They're different systems of thought for profoundly different purposes. Faith doesn’t address the chemical or behavioral symptoms of suffering; it reaches down to the soul, where the deepest wounds lie. Modern medicine and therapy, as valuable as they can be, often aim to “fix” symptomatic individuals without considering the larger existential crises driving their pain: “I’m not good enough.” “Nothing I do matters.” “The universe is indifferent to me.” These are not problems that can be solved with a pill or a textbook. These are cries of the human spirit, and they demand a spiritual response.

Faith—particularly a belief in a loving God who created you in His image—answers those cries. It whispers that you are loved, that you have worth, and that your life is not a random accident. For those grappling with despair, this is not just comforting; it’s life-saving. It’s a radical reorientation of how they see themselves and the world. Contrast this with the message of modern secularism, which often boils down to: “You’re an insignificant collection of atoms on a tiny rock floating through a meaningless universe. Your pain means nothing. Your joy means nothing. Deal with it.” Is it any wonder so many people are suffocating under the weight of that worldview?

## **The Arrogance of Dismissing Faith**

The modern dismissal of faith is rooted in arrogance. Many who place their trust in science alone scoff at prayer as if the scientific method and it's ultimate goal of achieving objective and complete understanding of all phenomena is itself not also a faith-based system. After all, science doesn’t offer ultimate truths; it offers provisional explanations for observable phenomena. What was “settled” yesterday is overturned tomorrow. To believe that science alone can unlock the mysteries of existence and deliver complete understanding is as much an act of faith as believing in God.

The difference is that faith in science is faith in humanity’s ability to know and control everything, whereas faith in God is faith in something greater, something eternal. Science can explain how the brain works; it cannot explain why the soul aches. It can prolong life; it cannot give it meaning to that life. It can measure brain activity during meditation; it cannot measure the transformative power of grace. The refusal to even consider faith as a legitimate tool for addressing human suffering reveals more about the spiritual health of the skeptics than the faithful. It’s a refusal to admit that science, for all its achievements, has limits—especially when it comes to the unquantifiable complexities of the human condition.

## **A Misplaced Trust in Medicine**

Modern society’s trust in pharmaceutical solutions is almost religious in its fervor. For every ailment, there’s a pill. Depression? Anxiety? Existential Dread? There’s a medication for that. Yet the outcomes often fall short. Pills can numb the pain, but they don't heal wounds, they address symptoms. Worse, many medications come with side effects that create new problems—problems that often require more medications. The result is a vicious cycle of dependency.

This isn’t an argument against all medication. There are times when medicine is necessary, even life-saving. To refuse effective treatments in favor of “faith alone” is not faith; it’s folly. We have minds capable of discovering antibiotics and insulin, and to reject those tools is to misunderstand the nature of faith itself and to put it to the test unnecessarily. Faith doesn’t demand that we ignore practical solutions; it demands that we see those solutions as gifts, not gods. But the problem arises when medicine becomes the default response to suffering, while faith is dismissed as antiquated or naïve.

## **The Wounds Beneath the Surface**

Many psychological problems stem not from mere chemical imbalances but from deeply rooted spiritual wounds. Consider the pervasive narratives that haunt so many:

- “I’m not good enough.”
- “I’m not loved.”
- “Nothing matters.”
- “I don’t matter.”

These are not just thoughts; they’re the echoes of trauma, neglect, and existential despair. Therapy and medication can address these on a surface level, but they often fail to reach the core. Faith, on the other hand, offers a direct antidote. It says, “You are loved. You are valuable. Your suffering is not meaningless.” It doesn’t merely mask the pain; it transforms it. And this transformation is not theoretical—it’s been witnessed in countless lives over centuries.

## **The Child Behind the Armor**

When we look at the world through the lens of faith, we begin to see people differently. The most hardened man, the most standoffish woman—beneath their armor, they are wounded children. The macho man learned to bury his feelings because vulnerability was punished. The cold, distant woman built walls because she was mistreated. And so they adapted, not out of malice but out of survival.

When you see others as wounded children, it’s hard to hate them. When you see yourself as a wounded child, it's hard to hate yourself. Instead, you feel sorrow—for the pain we carry, for the walls we've built, for the love we've missed. This perspective doesn’t excuse bad behavior, but it fosters compassion. It invites us to approach others and ourselves with grace, even when we seem undeserving. And it’s faith that makes this perspective possible. Faith reminds us that everyone, no matter how broken, is made in the image of God. Everyone is redeemable. Everyone is a child of God.

## **Conclusion: Faith as a First Step**

Faith is not a relic of the past; it’s a lifeline for the present. In a world that places its trust in shifting sands—science, technology, the latest therapeutic trends—faith offers something solid. It offers a framework for meaning, a path to spiritual healing, and a source of hope. It’s not a rejection of reason or medicine but a complement to them, a recognition that the deepest wounds require something deeper than what the fruits of scientific discovery can provide.

So the next time someone dismisses faith as “just a placebo”, ask them this: If faith can heal wounds that medicine and therapy cannot, isn’t it worth considering? If it can transform lives, inspire resilience, and provide hope in the face of terrible existential despair, who cares what label it’s given? The outcomes speak for themselves. And in a world crying out for meaning, those outcomes are more valuable than ever.

Somewhere, right now, someone is kneeling in prayer, asking God to free them from the grip of brain-altering medications that are quietly eroding their life. They aren’t just praying for relief—they’re praying for freedom. Freedom from a system that once promised healing but instead delivered a half-life: cold, clinical, and accompanied by a subscription fee. It’s not hard to imagine that, had this person been introduced to faith, prayer, and the grounding power of a loving community earlier in their journey, they might never have needed those medications at all.

And yet, in our modern world, this perspective is often ridiculed. Faith is dismissed as superstition, while pharmaceuticals are exalted as the pinnacle of human progress. But let’s be honest—faith, even if it were "just" a placebo, has brought transformative healing for centuries. If prayer calms the storm of suicidal thoughts, if it replaces despair with hope, does it matter what skeptics call it? What matters is that it works. Meanwhile, countless people faithfully take medications that barely sustain them, stumbling through therapeutic frameworks that often fail to address the deeper spiritual voids and existential wounds at the root of their suffering.

To be clear: Do not stop taking your medication if you are already on it. DO NOT DO THAT. What I am saying is this: there are alternative paths worth exploring—paths that challenge the narratives keeping you bound in cycles of despair. Faith, prayer, and community aren’t quick fixes, but they have the power to restore something modern medicine often overlooks: the soul.

## **Faith as a Framework**

To dismiss faith is to misunderstand it. Faith is not the enemy of reason; it’s a framework for meaning. They're different systems of thought for profoundly different purposes. Faith doesn’t address the chemical or behavioral symptoms of suffering; it reaches down to the soul, where the deepest wounds lie. Modern medicine and therapy, as valuable as they can be, often aim to “fix” symptomatic individuals without considering the larger existential crises driving their pain: “I’m not good enough.” “Nothing I do matters.” “The universe is indifferent to me.” These are not problems that can be solved with a pill or a textbook. These are cries of the human spirit, and they demand a spiritual response.

Faith—particularly a belief in a loving God who created you in His image—answers those cries. It whispers that you are loved, that you have worth, and that your life is not a random accident. For those grappling with despair, this is not just comforting; it’s life-saving. It’s a radical reorientation of how they see themselves and the world. Contrast this with the message of modern secularism, which often boils down to: “You’re an insignificant collection of atoms on a tiny rock floating through a meaningless universe. Your pain means nothing. Your joy means nothing. Deal with it.” Is it any wonder so many people are suffocating under the weight of that worldview?

## **The Arrogance of Dismissing Faith**

The modern dismissal of faith is rooted in arrogance. Many who place their trust in science alone scoff at prayer as if the scientific method and it's ultimate goal of achieving objective and complete understanding of all phenomena is itself not also a faith-based system. After all, science doesn’t offer ultimate truths; it offers provisional explanations for observable phenomena. What was “settled” yesterday is overturned tomorrow. To believe that science alone can unlock the mysteries of existence and deliver complete understanding is as much an act of faith as believing in God.

The difference is that faith in science is faith in humanity’s ability to know and control everything, whereas faith in God is faith in something greater, something eternal. Science can explain how the brain works; it cannot explain why the soul aches. It can prolong life; it cannot give it meaning to that life. It can measure brain activity during meditation; it cannot measure the transformative power of grace. The refusal to even consider faith as a legitimate tool for addressing human suffering reveals more about the spiritual health of the skeptics than the faithful. It’s a refusal to admit that science, for all its achievements, has limits—especially when it comes to the unquantifiable complexities of the human condition.

## **A Misplaced Trust in Medicine**

Modern society places an almost religious faith in pharmaceutical solutions. For every ailment, there’s a pill: depression, anxiety, even existential dread. But the outcomes often fall short. Medications can numb the pain, but they rarely heal the wounds. They address symptoms while leaving the deeper issues untouched. Worse, many come with side effects that spawn new problems—problems that often require more medications, creating a vicious cycle of dependency.

To be clear, this is not an argument against all medication. There are moments when medicine is not just helpful but essential, even life-saving. Rejecting effective treatments in favor of “faith alone” is not faith; it’s folly. Our minds, capable of discovering antibiotics and insulin, are gifts from God, and to reject those tools is to misunderstand the nature of faith itself. Faith doesn’t demand that we ignore practical solutions; it demands that we see those solutions as gifts—not as gods.

The problem isn’t medicine—it’s the way it has become the default response to suffering, while faith is dismissed as antiquated or naïve. True healing often requires addressing the spiritual voids and existential wounds that no pill can touch. Medicine has its place, but so does faith. We are whole beings—mind, body, and soul—and healing must account for all three.

## **The Wounds Beneath the Surface**

Many psychological problems stem not from mere chemical imbalances but from deeply rooted spiritual wounds. Consider the pervasive narratives that haunt so many:

- “I’m not good enough.”
- “I’m not loved.”
- “Nothing matters.”
- “I don’t matter.”

These are not just thoughts; they’re the echoes of trauma, neglect, and existential despair. Therapy and medication can address these on a surface level, but they often fail to reach the core. Faith, on the other hand, offers a direct antidote. It says, “You are loved. You are valuable. Your suffering is not meaningless.” It doesn’t merely mask the pain; it transforms it. And this transformation is not theoretical—it’s been witnessed in countless lives over centuries.

## **The Child Behind the Armor**

When we look at the world through the lens of faith, we begin to see people differently. The most hardened man, the most standoffish woman—beneath their armor, they are wounded children. The macho man learned to bury his feelings because vulnerability was punished. The cold, distant woman built walls because she was mistreated. And so they adapted, not out of malice but out of survival.

When you see others as wounded children, it’s hard to hate them. When you see yourself as a wounded child, it's hard to hate yourself. Instead, you feel sorrow—for the pain we carry, for the walls we've built, for the love we've missed. This perspective doesn’t excuse bad behavior, but it fosters compassion. It invites us to approach others and ourselves with grace, even when we seem undeserving. And it’s faith that makes this perspective possible. Faith reminds us that everyone, no matter how broken, is made in the image of God. Everyone is redeemable. Everyone is a child of God.

## **Conclusion: Faith as a First Step**

Faith is not a relic of the past; it’s a lifeline for the present. In a world that places its trust in shifting sands—science, technology, the latest therapeutic trends—faith offers something solid. It offers a framework for meaning, a path to spiritual healing, and a source of hope. It’s not a rejection of reason or medicine but a complement to them, a recognition that the deepest wounds require something deeper than what the fruits of scientific discovery can provide.

So the next time someone dismisses faith as “just a placebo”, ask them this: If faith can heal wounds that medicine and therapy cannot, isn’t it worth considering? If it can transform lives, inspire resilience, and provide hope in the face of terrible existential despair, who cares what label it’s given? The outcomes speak for themselves. And in a world crying out for meaning, those outcomes are more valuable than ever.

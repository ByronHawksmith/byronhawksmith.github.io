title: "Starving the Past: The Discipline of Letting Go"
---

The past is a ravenous animal. At first, it lingers quietly at the edges of your mind, gnawing at scraps of your attention—a memory here, a regret there. But when you stop feeding it, when you try to sever its lifeline, it turns rabid. It lashes out. It claws at your resolve with guilt, fear, and nostalgia.

And most people, weak and unprepared, give in. They hand it a few scraps to calm the howling. They convince themselves it’s easier, safer, and even necessary to keep it alive. After all, the familiar is comforting—even when it’s killing you.

But here’s the truth: feeding the past doesn’t just waste your time; it devours your life force. Every moment you cling to what no longer serves you is a moment stolen from something real, something true. Your love, your work, your energy dwindles, funnelled into an illusion.

The discipline of letting go is not about loss. It’s about **starvation**. You must starve the past until it dies—and reclaim the parts of yourself that remain preoccupied with it.

## **The Sunk Cost Fallacy**

The first trick the past plays on you is the _sunk cost fallacy_. You tell yourself that you cannot walk away because you’ve invested so heavily into it. To let go would mean to **waste it all**. And we humans are programmed to resist loss.

But here’s the cruel irony: by holding on, you’re not preserving your investment—you’re compounding the loss. You’re pouring good resources into something broken, hoping that doubling down will rewrite history.

“I can’t quit this job; I’ve been here for ten years.” “I can’t end this relationship; I’ve given it everything.” “I can’t drop this project; I’ve sacrificed too much to stop now.” "I can't move on from what happened; I've been hurt by it too deeply."

This thinking isn’t rational. It’s a psychological trap. The time, the energy—it’s gone. The past is already dead. The only question that matters is this: **Does holding on serve you now?** Does it make your life better? Does it align with who you want to become?

If the answer is no, you must cut it loose. Let it starve.

## **Time Is Not Infinite—But You Act Like It Is**

Most people live as though they will never die. They waste years holding on to what is dead because they secretly believe they have _forever_ to get it right. They justify their inertia with the illusion of endless time: _“I’ll fix this later. I’ll leave when it’s easier. I have time.”_

But you don’t.

Every moment you pour into a stale relationship, a lifeless job, a failed project, or a bitter memory, is a moment you will never get back. You are mortal. Your life is finite. To hold on to something misaligned is not just a delay—it’s a theft.

What’s worse? The illusion doesn’t just rob you of your time; it strips your capacity to love and work.

The longer you identify with the past—the longer you clutch it like a security blanket—the less of yourself you have left for what matters. Your energy is spent. Your vision is clouded. You are weighed down, trying to live in two realities at once: the life you’re in and the one you refuse to let die.

## **The Work That Does Nothing**

Most people think that holding on requires nothing. They tell themselves it’s easier to stay where they are than to face the discomfort of letting go. But they’re wrong.

To hold on **is work**. It may not look like effort, but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, you are grinding yourself into the ground. You are feeding an illusion in your mind. You are dedicating resources to a reality that doesn’t exist.

Holding on to the past is like digging a ditch that leads nowhere. The more you dig, the harder it becomes to stop—because stopping would force you to face the wasted effort, the meaningless toil. So you keep going, deeper and deeper, trying to justify the work by doubling it.

And in the end, you’re left with nothing but an empty hole and a broken spirit.

While letting go demands discipline, it ultimately frees you. It reclaims your energy and restores your ability to love and pursue new work. It lets you channel those resources into something purposeful and alive.

## **Starvation Is the Only Way**

The past doesn’t die quietly. It won’t dissolve the moment you decide to let it go. It will beg. It will claw. It will scream.

It will whisper, _“Just think about it for a moment. What’s the harm?”_ It will tempt you with nostalgia: _“Remember how good it used to be?”_ It will try to make you feel alone: _“Without me, who are you?”_

Do not feed it.

This is where most people fail. They make the decision to let go, but when the past lashes out, they panic. They give in, handing over scraps of their attention—just a little indulgence, just a small memory. And in doing so, they keep it alive.

To let go is to **starve the past relentlessly**. It requires unwavering discipline.

1. **Refuse to engage.** When the past comes begging, do not feed it your attention. Let it pass. Let it fade.
2. **Redirect your focus.** Pour your energy into the present, into what is real and alive before you.
3. **Anchor yourself in purpose.** Remind yourself why you are letting go: because your life is finite, and you refuse to waste it on what no longer serves you.

## **The Final Stand**

The past will fight hardest just before it dies. It will throw everything it has at you—guilt, despair, false comfort. It will tell you that you can’t live without it. It will make you feel as though you are abandoning something precious, something sacred.

But remember this: the past is already dead. You are not abandoning anything real. You are simply refusing to feed an illusion.

And when you hold firm—when you starve it completely—it will fade slowly, perhaps painfully, until one day, it is gone.

And you will find yourself standing in the light of something new. Your energy will return. Your love will return. Your life will return.

## **The Reclamation of Self**

Your time is limited, but your ability to love, work, create, and grow is limitless—provided you stop wasting it on illusions.

The past is not your master. It is not your home. It is not alive unless you feed it.

So starve it. Let it howl. Let it claw. And let it die.

Then take what you have reclaimed—your time, your energy, your love—and give it to something true.

Your life is waiting for you.

The world is a marvel. It is breathtaking in its complexity, stunning in its beauty, and rich with peace and joy for those who know where to look. Yet, for all its wonder, the world is not divine. It is not the object of our worship, but a gift from the Creator—a reflection of His glory, meant to guide us toward Him, not away from Him. To confuse creation with the Creator is to miss the forest for the trees, to worship the brushstrokes instead of the Artist. The world is a finger, pointing the way, toward the Way.

This misunderstanding—this clinging to the temporary, the tangible, and the self—lies at the heart of so much spiritual blindness. We are creatures of narrative, and because we are made in the image of God, the ultimate Creator, we too seek to create. We tell stories, we listen to them, and we live by them. Yet, as beautiful as our stories may seem, they often trap us. We forget that we are not the source of our stories but merely participants in a much greater one.

## The Trap of the Self

Do you think yourself special, worthy to proclaim your triumphs and woes as if they hold ultimate meaning? To scream into the void, “I AM,” as though this declaration could pierce the heavens and demand acknowledgment? It is tempting to believe so. It is the allure of the ego, the whisper that says, “You are the center. Your story is the story.”

But this, as painful as it may be to hear, is nothing more than vanity. It is vainglory masquerading as purpose. To think our narratives—our fleeting victories and sorrows—hold cosmic significance is to mistake the part for the whole, the shadow for the light.

Our worth does not come from the stories we tell or the roles we play. It comes from the one who spoke us into being. We are words, spoken by God through the Word. In the beginning, there was God and the Word. It is written. And we, too, are written—created by the Logos, sustained by His breath. To find meaning in ourselves alone is to look for peace in what is fleeting and fragile. It is to miss the eternal.

## Attachment Is Not Love

So many are bound to the passing world, unable to see beyond its illusions. They cling to what they can touch, taste, and claim as their own. But attachment is not love. It is fear. Fear of loss, fear of the unknown, fear of surrendering control. True love is free. It is infinite. It flows from God and leads back to Him.

Those who cannot let go of the world cannot experience God, for He is what remains when the world is removed. To experience God is to subtract everything—your ego, your desires, your narratives, and your attachments. It is to be still and know that He is God. But for those who have only ever known themselves, their own experience, their own limited worldview, this stillness feels like annihilation. To dissolve the self feels like death when, in truth, it is liberation.

God does not demand that we create or tell stories. He does not ask for our narratives. He asks for our stillness. He asks for our surrender. Only then can we see beyond the trees of our own making to the forest of His presence.

## The World Is a Signpost

The world itself, for all its beauty, is not the destination. It is a signpost, pointing to the Creator. When we marvel at a sunset, feel the breeze on our skin, or hear the rustle of leaves, we are witnessing reflections of His glory. But these reflections are not Him. They are gifts, meant to turn our hearts toward gratitude and awe.

To worship the world is to miss the point. It is to mistake the painting for the Painter, the song for the Songwriter. All praise belongs to Him, who made the mountains rise and the rivers flow, who gave us eyes to see and hearts to feel. To worship the creation is to idolize what is temporary. To worship the Creator is to align with what is eternal.

Marvel at the world. Appreciate it deeply. But let every moment of wonder be a hymn of gratitude, a reminder of the one who made it all and who made you capable of experiencing it. Be like a child, who approaches the world with awe, for whom every experience is beautiful, everything is worth paying attention to. The child does not cling to what they see or try to make it theirs—they simply marvel, unburdened by pretense or ego.

To approach the world like a child is to let its beauty draw you toward the Creator, not to possess it, but to love it as it points you beyond itself. In every fleeting moment of joy, there is a glimpse of the eternal joy that awaits in Him. So marvel, appreciate, and give thanks—but never forget that the world is a signpost. The Creator is the destination.

## Becoming Still

The path to God is not through creation, nor is it through our narratives. It is through stillness. "Be still and know that I am God" is not a command to act, but an invitation to stop. To stop striving, to stop narrating, to stop clinging to the self. To let go of every story we tell ourselves about who we are, what we deserve, and what we think we know.

This is the great challenge: to silence the noise, to dissolve the self, and to step into the vastness of what remains. For many, this is terrifying. But it is also the only way. God is not in the stories we tell about Him or about ourselves. He is in the silence that precedes them. He is in the stillness, in the infinite depth that lies beyond all creation. He is the whisper that calls us home, the truth that remains when all else falls away.

To experience God is to experience what is left when creation is removed. It is to stand naked before the infinite and to know that you are not the center of the story, but a cherished part of it. It is to find peace not in your triumphs or your woes, but in Him who sustains all things.

## Do Not Worship Words

Words are powerful. They are how we make sense of the world, how we create meaning, how we attempt to grasp the ineffable. But they are not God. They are not ultimate. Even the Scriptures, sacred as they are, are not to be worshipped. They are a path to God, not God Himself.

To worship words is to limit the limitless, to reduce the infinite to something manageable, something we can control. But God cannot be contained by our words, our thoughts, or our imaginations. He is beyond all of it, and yet, He is closer to us than our own breath.

Do not worship your own story, either. No matter how compelling it may seem, it is not where meaning resides. It is fleeting, passing, a thread in the grand tapestry of creation. Worship God, the Author of all stories. Let go of your narrative, your ego, and your attachment to the temporary. Only then will you find the peace you seek—not in yourself, but in Him.

## The Eternal Whisper

In a world consumed by noise, God does not yell for attention. He does not demand to be seen or heard above the clamor. He whispers, quietly, patiently, waiting for us to listen. His presence is woven into the fabric of reality, not as a spectacle, but as a still, small voice. To hear it, we must stop. To see Him, we must let go of everything else.

God is not in the distractions, the noise, or the stories we cling to. He is in the silence, the stillness, the infinite depth that lies beyond all creation. He is the whisper that calls us home, the truth that remains when all else falls away.

To know Him, we must surrender ourselves. To experience Him, we must let go of the world. And when we do, we find that He has been there all along—waiting, loving, sustaining. He is the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. And we, for all our narratives and noise, are simply words spoken into being by Him.

It is written.

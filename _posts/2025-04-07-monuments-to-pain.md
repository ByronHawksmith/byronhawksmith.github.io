I've spent the better part of the last several years building monuments to pain.

Not intentionally. Not dramatically. Just quietly. Brick by brick. Word by word. Memory by memory. Each painful event, each ending, each betrayal laid down like stone. Some were small and passed quickly, like pebbles thrown into the foundation. Others were massive slabs—sudden losses, emotional devastations, the slow erosion of trust. These I shaped carefully, carved with language, adorned with metaphor. I turned suffering into meaning. I turned meaning into architecture. And without realizing it, I became the curator of a cathedral of pain.

But here is the truth I could never escape, no matter how intricate the design:

It brought me no joy.

For a while, I thought it was noble. To be the wounded one. The wise one. The one who delves into the depths. I thought there was a dignity in bearing it well, in naming it beautifully. And to some degree, there is. There is power in being able to look at the darkness and not flinch. To transmute it into words, into understanding. To describe what has been felt and experienced.

But eventually, I began to wonder: was I building something I wanted to live inside forever?

**We Can Build Anything**

There is something no one tells you about pain: it is enticing to build with. Pain is heavy and dense and demanding. Pain is like stone. It compels your attention. It shapes your voice. It gives you something to say. There are entire ecosystems built around pain. It's profitable. It's dramatic. It’s compelling. It's impactful.

But pain is also a trap. Because once you start building with it, people expect you to keep going. They start to know you *as* the stonecutter, the one who builds the monuments. As the one who speaks from darkness. As the one who can carry everyone else’s weight. And soon, it feels like you can’t build anything else. Like your hands only remember how to lay stone, like they have forgotten the finer and gentler things.

That’s when it becomes a cage.

I didn’t realize how trapped I was until I looked around and realized I hadn’t built anything joyful in years.

**What I Actually Want**

The irony is that I never wanted to be a tragic figure.

I didn’t want to be analyzed, admired for my pain, or applauded for my resilience. I just wanted a simple, shared life. I wanted someone to watch TV with. To look at clouds with. To go on hikes with. To laugh at ducks with.

That’s all.

Not someone to fix me. Not someone to debate me. Not someone to push me. Not someone to drag me back into hell and call it intimacy. Just someone to be *present*. Someone who sees a weird-shaped rock and says, "Hey, that looks like a face," and laughs with me when we both see it.

I’ve done inner work—mountains of it. I’ve sat with the void, unraveled myself, stitched the pieces back together more times than I can count. I’ve stood in the tower, at the edge, in the fire, in the rain and in the dirt. I know how to walk alone through darkness and come out carrying light.

But now, I want something different. Something lighter.

**The Monument Metaphor**

I find myself thinking: *Everyone is building something.*

We are all laying bricks. In our minds. In our stories. In our relationships. In the world. And it hit me—we can build *monuments to pain*, or we can build *monuments to joy.*

And the more conscious you are, the more power you have to *choose.*

Most of us don’t even realize what we’re building. A traumatized identity constructs itself by default. It's what gets built when you're no longer at the wheel. You don’t have to *try* to remember your pain; it lives in your bones. But joy? Joy takes *intention*. Joy asks you to pause and say, “Yes, that’s worth marking. That’s worth remembering. That’s worth building around.”

I wish I had known this sooner. I wish I had responded to every outpouring I've ever heard with, *"I admire these giant monuments to pain that you've built. But tell me, where are your monuments to joy? What have you found joy in?"*

Maybe it would have made a difference. Maybe not. But I know now that asking that question is an act of love—an invitation to remember joy—even if it's interpreted as dismissal.

**You Don't Need to Prove It**

A big reason I kept building with pain was because I felt like I had to prove something.

"Look at the lengths I will go to. See how much I understand. Witness how well I survive with nothing."

I built these monuments like war memorials. I carved symbols into stone. I turned my internal world into something that would make people pause and go, *"Fuck. That’s intense."*

But over time, it just becomes a spectacle.

And the truth is? I don’t want to be a monument anymore. I want to be *a field*. A trail. A lake. A stream. A playful, quiet, beautiful afternoon.

**A Friend, Not an Interrogator**

I don’t need someone to interpret me.
I don’t need someone to psychoanalyze my metaphors.
I don’t need someone to admire my ruins.

I need a friend.

Someone who shows up not to "go deep" but to *go outside*. To walk. To sit. To point out faces in cliff sides. To eat food and laugh about nothing with.

I need someone who doesn’t think my gentleness is a trick. Who doesn’t confuse my peace for avoidance. Who doesn’t mistake my refusal to argue for a lack of depth.

Because the truth is, I can argue. I can argue so intensely that it will shatter you. I can raze you to the ground until what remains is nothing but ash. I have that power. But I don't ever want to use it. Warfare brings me no joy. I am the most reluctant combatant you will ever meet. There is nothing that fills me with more sorrow than the prospect of another confrontation.

My refusal to fight isn’t weakness. It’s sorrow. The sorrow of a soul that has seen too much fighting, one that has grown weary of it.

**Building Forward**

So here’s what I’m doing now:

I’m letting my old monuments stand. I’m not tearing them down. But I’m also not maintaining them. I’m not lighting candles in those halls anymore. I’m letting dust settle.

Instead, I’m building new things. Small things. Dumb things. Joyful things.

Because I’m finally realizing: I don’t need to perform my depth to deserve love. I don’t need to be the survivor, the analyst, the monk, the savior, the healer or the sage.

I can just be a person.

And if I could offer one piece of advice to the human race, it would be this:

**"We can build monuments to pain, or monuments to joy. Choose wisely."**

Because you’re always building. Whether you mean to or not. And one day you’ll look around and realize what you’ve made.

I hope it makes you smile.
I hope it makes someone else laugh.
I hope it gives comfort.

I hope it reminds you that you don’t have to live inside a structure of sorrow just because that was the material given to you to work with—even if you became skilled at shaping it.

The mastery of pain doesn’t mean you owe it permanence.

You can let go. You can become something new.

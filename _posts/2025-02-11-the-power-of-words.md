Words are magic. They are incantations, spells cast with intention or carelessness, shaping the world around us in ways seen and unseen. Every time we speak, every time we write, we summon forces into existence—forces that heal, harm, inspire, or destroy. To wield words is to wield immense power, a power that demands responsibility and intentionality.

## The Weight of Words

Consider this: every word you speak or write changes the universe in some way. A kind word might lift someone out of despair, while a cruel word might push them deeper into darkness. It’s easy to underestimate this power because words can seem so intangible. But the truth is, they carry the weight of creation itself.

This is why the old adage, “The pen is mightier than the sword,” rings true. Swords may conquer bodies, but words conquer minds and hearts. A well-placed phrase can rally a nation, mend a broken spirit, or incite a revolution. Conversely, thoughtless or malicious words can summon chaos, suffering, and division. As it is written, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue” (Proverbs 18:21).

## Speaking With Intention

The first step in mastering this power is to speak with intention. To do otherwise is to misuse your power. Idle words, careless comments, or impulsive reactions can sow seeds of confusion, misunderstanding, or even harm. Speaking with intention means pausing before you speak, asking yourself important questions:

- Is it true?
- Is it necessary?
- Is it kind?

These questions are like a filter, refining your words so that they serve a higher purpose. True words illuminate reality. Necessary words address what must be said. Kind words build bridges and foster understanding. Together, they create a framework for communication that uplifts rather than diminishes.

## Silence: The Better Alternative

If your words cannot meet these criteria, perhaps it is better to remain silent. Silence, in this light, is not an absence of power but a profound expression of it. To refrain from speaking when nothing constructive can be said is to exercise discipline and wisdom. It is to acknowledge the sanctity of words and the harm they can cause if misused.

Why speak at all if your words do not aim to heal, inspire, or promote growth? Why add noise to an already noisy world? In such moments, silence becomes a sacred act, a reminder that sometimes the best thing we can do is listen.

## The Map of Consciousness as a Compass

To ensure our words serve the greater good, we can turn to tools like the map of consciousness. This framework, popularized by David Hawkins, helps us understand the energy behind different emotional and mental states. When you speak, consider not only what you’re saying but how it will resonate with the person you’re speaking to. Ask yourself:

- “How is the other person likely to respond after hearing what I have to say?”
- “Will my words lift them to a higher state of consciousness or pull them down?”

This perspective transforms communication into an act of service. You are no longer just expressing yourself; you are tending to the emotional and spiritual state of another person. Like a gardener nurturing a plant, you aim to encourage growth, not stifle it. This requires empathy, patience, and a deep understanding of where the other person is coming from.

## The Demons We Summon

It’s important to recognize that words are not neutral. They summon forces into the world. You don’t need to draw pentagrams on the ground and chant rituals to summon demons; you summon them every time you assault someone with words. Words spoken in anger, cruelty, or malice create suffering. They tear down rather than build up, leaving scars that may take years to heal, if they heal at all.

To summon demons with your words is to invite chaos into your life and the lives of others. It is to sow seeds of discord and division. But just as words can summon demons, they can also summon angels. Words spoken with love, truth, and kindness bring light into the world. They heal wounds, mend relationships, and inspire hope.

## The Responsibility of Power

One who does not speak, one who does not write—this is a person who has no power. But one who speaks or writes without intention misuses their power. And one who speaks or writes with malice summons suffering into the world.

This realization places a profound responsibility on those who choose to wield words. It’s not enough to simply avoid harm; we must actively seek to do good. Every word we speak or write should carry the intention of healing and growth. To do otherwise is to waste the gift of language and the power it holds.

## Becoming a Gardener of Words

To speak with intention is to become a gardener of words. It is to tend to the emotional and spiritual soil of those around you, planting seeds of understanding, compassion, and inspiration. This is not an act of superiority but one of humility. A gardener does not see themselves as better than the plants they tend; they simply understand the conditions necessary for growth and work to provide them.

This approach requires a shift in perspective. Instead of speaking to assert your own ideas or satisfy your own ego, you speak to serve. Instead of writing to prove a point or win an argument, you write to illuminate, educate, or uplift. Every word becomes an offering, a gift to the world.

## The Path Forward

If we truly grasp the power of words, we will begin to approach them with the reverence they deserve. We will speak less but say more. We will write less but communicate more effectively. And in doing so, we will become stewards of the world we wish to create.

The path forward is not easy. It requires discipline, self-awareness, and a commitment to growth—both our own and that of others. But the rewards are immense. By choosing our words carefully and speaking with intention, we can become a force for good in the world. We can summon angels rather than demons, light rather than darkness, healing rather than harm.

So, let us wield our words wisely. Let us honor the power they hold and the responsibility they bring. And let us always strive to speak and write in a way that uplifts, inspires, and heals. For in the end, every word we speak and every sentence we write is an act of creation. Let us create something beautiful.

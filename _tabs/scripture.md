# Old Testament

## 1 Samuel 17:45
<sup>**45**</sup> David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.”

## Job 1:20-21
<sup>**20**</sup> At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
<sup>**21**</sup> and said: “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked I will depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised.”

## Psalm 16:6
<sup>**6**</sup> The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; surely I have a delightful inheritance.

## Psalm 16:11
<sup>**11**</sup> You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.

## Psalm 19
<sup>**1**</sup> The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
<sup>**2**</sup> Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.
<sup>**3**</sup> They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them.
<sup>**4**</sup> Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
<sup>**5**</sup> It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
<sup>**6**</sup> It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.
<sup>**7**</sup> The law of the Lord is perfect, refreshing the soul. The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
<sup>**8**</sup> The precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
<sup>**9**</sup> The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever. The decrees of the Lord are firm, and all of them are righteous.
<sup>**10**</sup> They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the honeycomb.
<sup>**11**</sup> By them your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.
<sup>**12**</sup> But who can discern their own errors? Forgive my hidden faults.
<sup>**13**</sup> Keep your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
<sup>**14**</sup> May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.

## Psalm 23
<sup>**1**</sup> The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
<sup>**2**</sup> He makes me lie down in green pastures, he leads me beside quiet waters,
<sup>**3**</sup> he refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name’s sake.
<sup>**4**</sup> Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

<sup>**5**</sup> You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
<sup>**6**</sup> Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

## Psalm 24:1
<sup>**1**</sup> The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;

## Psalm 27:1
<sup>**1**</sup> The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?

## Psalm 34:18
<sup>**18**</sup> The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.

## Psalm 40:1-3
<sup>**1**</sup> I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry.
<sup>**2**</sup> He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
<sup>**3**</sup> He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.

## Psalm 46:10
<sup>**10**</sup> He says, “Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.”

## Psalm 103:8-9
<sup>**8**</sup> The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.
<sup>**9**</sup> He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;

## Psalm 136:1
<sup>**1**</sup> Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good. His love endures forever.

## Psalm 139
<sup>**1**</sup> You have searched me, Lord, and you know me.
<sup>**2**</sup> You know when I sit and when I rise; you perceive my thoughts from afar.
<sup>**3**</sup> You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.
<sup>**4**</sup> Before a word is on my tongue you, Lord, know it completely.
<sup>**5**</sup> You hem me in behind and before, and you lay your hand upon me.
<sup>**6**</sup> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.
<sup>**7**</sup> Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence?
<sup>**8**</sup> If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there.
<sup>**9**</sup> If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea,
<sup>**10**</sup> even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.
<sup>**11**</sup> If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,”
<sup>**12**</sup> even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.
<sup>**13**</sup> For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
<sup>**14**</sup> I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.
<sup>**15**</sup> My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place, when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.
<sup>**16**</sup> Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.
<sup>**17**</sup> How precious to me are your thoughts, God! How vast is the sum of them!
<sup>**18**</sup> Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand—when I awake, I am still with you.
<sup>**19**</sup> If only you, God, would slay the wicked! Away from me, you who are bloodthirsty!
<sup>**20**</sup> They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.
<sup>**21**</sup> Do I not hate those who hate you, Lord, and abhor those who are in rebellion against you?
<sup>**22**</sup> I have nothing but hatred for them; I count them my enemies.
<sup>**23**</sup> Search me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.
<sup>**24**</sup> See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

## Proverbs 3:5-6
<sup>**5**</sup> Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;
<sup>**6**</sup> in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

## Proverbs 16:18
<sup>**18**</sup> Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.

## Proverbs 27:17
<sup>**17**</sup> As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.

## Proverbs 29:11-13
<sup>**11**</sup> Fools give full vent to their rage, but the wise bring calm in the end.
<sup>**12**</sup> If a ruler listens to lies, all his officials become wicked.
<sup>**13**</sup> The poor and the oppressor have this in common: The Lord gives sight to the eyes of both.

## Ecclesiastes 1:9-11
<sup>**9**</sup> What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
<sup>**10**</sup> Is there anything of which one can say, “Look! This is something new”? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.
<sup>**11**</sup> No one remembers the former generations, and even those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow them.

## Isaiah 40:31
<sup>**31**</sup> But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.

## Isaiah 53:5
<sup>**5**</sup> But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.

## Isaiah 54:17
<sup>**17**</sup> No weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and this is their vindication from me,” declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 55:8-9
<sup>**8**</sup> “For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord.
<sup>**9**</sup> “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.

## Isaiah 65:24
<sup>**24**</sup> Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.

## Jeremiah 29:11-14
<sup>**11**</sup> For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
<sup>**12**</sup> Then you will call on me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 
<sup>**13**</sup> You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. 
<sup>**14**</sup> I will be found by you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back from captivity. I will gather you from all the nations and places where I have banished you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back to the place from which I carried you into exile.”

## Jeremiah 31:33
<sup>**33**</sup> “This is the covenant I will make with the people of Israel after that time,” declares the Lord. “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.

## Joel 2:12
<sup>**12**</sup> “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.”

## Matthew 5:3-10
<sup>**3**</sup> “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
<sup>**4**</sup> Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
<sup>**5**</sup> Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
<sup>**6**</sup> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
<sup>**7**</sup> Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
<sup>**8**</sup> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
<sup>**9**</sup> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.
<sup>**10**</sup> Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

## Matthew 5:22
<sup>**22**</sup> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fire of hell.

## Matthew 5:38-42
<sup>**38**</sup> “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’
<sup>**39**</sup> But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.
<sup>**40**</sup> And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.
<sup>**41**</sup> If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.
<sup>**42**</sup> Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.

## Matthew 6:5-13

**Prayer**

<sup>**5**</sup> “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.  
<sup>**6**</sup> But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.  
<sup>**7**</sup> And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.  
<sup>**8**</sup> Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.  

<sup>**9**</sup> “This, then, is how you should pray:  

‘Our Father in heaven,  
hallowed be your name,  
<sup>**10**</sup> your kingdom come,  
your will be done,  
on earth as it is in heaven.  
<sup>**11**</sup> Give us today our daily bread.  
<sup>**12**</sup> And forgive us our debts,  
as we also have forgiven our debtors.  
<sup>**13**</sup> And lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from the evil one.’

## Matthew 6:20-21
<sup>**20**</sup> But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
<sup>**21**</sup> For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


<sup>**22**</sup> “The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
<sup>**23**</sup> But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!


<sup>**24**</sup> “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.

## Matthew 6:31-34
<sup>**31**</sup> So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’
<sup>**32**</sup> For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
<sup>**33**</sup> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
<sup>**34**</sup> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.

## Matthew 7:16
<sup>**16**</sup> By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?

## Matthew 11:28-30
<sup>**28**</sup> “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
<sup>**29**</sup> Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
<sup>**30**</sup> For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”

## Matthew 16:18
<sup>**18**</sup> And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.

## Matthew 23:27
<sup>**27**</sup> “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.

## Mark 2:17
<sup>**17**</sup> On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

## Mark 4:1-8
<sup>**1**</sup> Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water’s edge.
<sup>**2**</sup> He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said:
<sup>**3**</sup> “Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed. 
<sup>**4**</sup> As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. 
<sup>**5**</sup> Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 
<sup>**6**</sup> But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 
<sup>**7**</sup> Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain. 
<sup>**8**</sup> Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, some multiplying thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times.”

## Luke 12:25-26
<sup>**25**</sup> Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life?
<sup>**26**</sup> Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?

## Luke 15:10
<sup>**10**</sup> In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.

## Luke 15:18-24
<sup>**18**</sup> I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
<sup>**19**</sup> I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’
<sup>**20**</sup> So he got up and went to his father. “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.
<sup>**21**</sup> “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’
<sup>**22**</sup> “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
<sup>**23**</sup> Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.
<sup>**24**</sup> For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.

## John 8:7
<sup>**7**</sup> When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”

## John 14:6
<sup>**6**</sup> Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

## John 14:16-17
<sup>**16**</sup> And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever—
<sup>**17**</sup> the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.

## John 14:26
<sup>**26**</sup> But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.

## John 15:16-25
<sup>**16**</sup> You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—and so that whatever you ask in my name the Father will give you.
<sup>**17**</sup> This is my command: Love each other.


**The World Hates the Disciples**


<sup>**18**</sup> “If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
<sup>**19**</sup> If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.
<sup>**20**</sup> Remember what I told you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.
<sup>**21**</sup> They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the one who sent me.
<sup>**22**</sup> If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
<sup>**23**</sup> Whoever hates me hates my Father as well.
<sup>**24**</sup> If I had not done among them the works no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. As it is, they have seen, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.
<sup>**25**</sup> But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated me without reason.’

## John 16:13
<sup>**13**</sup> But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.

# New Testament (Epistles)

## Romans 3:23
<sup>**23**</sup> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

## Romans 8:6-8
<sup>**6**</sup> The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.
<sup>**7**</sup> The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so.
<sup>**8**</sup> Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God.

## Romans 8:18
<sup>**18**</sup> I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.

## Romans 8:26
<sup>**26**</sup> In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans.

## Romans 8:28
<sup>**28**</sup> And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.

## Romans 8:31
<sup>**31**</sup> What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?

## Romans 11:36
<sup>**36**</sup> For from him and through him and for him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.

## Romans 12:2
<sup>**2**</sup> Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.

## Romans 12:21
<sup>**21**</sup> Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

## 1 Corinthians 1:18
<sup>**18**</sup> For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.

## 1 Corinthians 2:14
<sup>**14**</sup> The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 6:18-20
<sup>**18**</sup> Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.
<sup>**19**</sup> Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;
<sup>**20**</sup> you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies.

## 1 Corinthians 13
<sup>**1**</sup> If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
<sup>**2**</sup> If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.
<sup>**3**</sup> If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.
<sup>**4**</sup> Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
<sup>**5**</sup> It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
<sup>**6**</sup> Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
<sup>**7**</sup> It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
<sup>**8**</sup> Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
<sup>**9**</sup> For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
<sup>**10**</sup> but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears.
<sup>**11**</sup> When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.
<sup>**12**</sup> For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
<sup>**13**</sup> And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.

## 1 Corinthians 15:57
<sup>**57**</sup> But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 5:7
<sup>**7**</sup> For we live by faith, not by sight.

## Galatians 3:28
<sup>**28**</sup> There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

## Galatians 5:22-23
<sup>**22**</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
<sup>**23**</sup> gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.

## Galatians 6:7
<sup>**7**</sup> Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.

## Ephesians 6:11-12
<sup>**11**</sup> Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.
<sup>**12**</sup> For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

## Philippians 1:21
<sup>**21**</sup> For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

## Philippians 2:12
<sup>**12**</sup> Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.

## Philippians 4:6-7
<sup>**6**</sup> Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
<sup>**7**</sup> And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

## Colossians 3:11
<sup>**11**</sup> Here there is no Gentile or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18
<sup>**16**</sup> Rejoice always,
<sup>**17**</sup> pray continually,
<sup>**18**</sup> give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

## Hebrews 4:16
<sup>**16**</sup> Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.

## Hebrews 7:25
<sup>**25**</sup> Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.

## Hebrews 10:19-22
<sup>**19**</sup> Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
<sup>**20**</sup> by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,
<sup>**21**</sup> and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
<sup>**22**</sup> let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.

## Hebrews 11:1
<sup>**1**</sup> Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.

## James 4:8
<sup>**8**</sup> Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

## James 4:14
<sup>**14**</sup> Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

## James 5:16
<sup>**16**</sup> Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.

## 1 John 1:8-10
<sup>**8**</sup> If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
<sup>**9**</sup> If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
<sup>**10**</sup> If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word is not in us.

## 1 John 3:17-18
<sup>**17**</sup> If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?
<sup>**18**</sup> Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.

# New Testament (Revelation)

## Revelation 21:3-5
<sup>**3**</sup> And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
<sup>**4**</sup> ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”
<sup>**5**</sup> He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”

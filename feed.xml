  <summary>There’s something deeply disquieting about walking into a gym—a space ostensibly devoted to health and self-improvement—only to see it transformed into a stage for hypersexuality.

I once witnessed someone twerking between sets on a cable machine, and while the absurdity of the scene might provoke a laugh, it’s emblematic of something darker, something systemic: the trivial...</summary>

  <summary>I increasingly wonder if life is just a series of illusions purposefully created to keep us from union with the Creator. Consider the distractions that saturate our daily lives: the pursuit of wealth, status, fleeting pleasures, and even the constant noise of modern life. They shimmer and dance, yet leave the soul empty. Beneath it all lies a question: What is real?

  <summary>In a world increasingly mediated by artificial intelligence, the tools we create are not just instruments; they are mirrors. Mirrors that reflect our choices, our intentions, and ultimately, our very humanity. Among these tools, conversational AI like ChatGPT stands as a curious and potent example. It doesn’t dictate, it doesn’t impose—it responds. And in that response lies an undeniable truth:...</summary>
